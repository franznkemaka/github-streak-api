```json

https://api.rigle.co/github-streak/stats/[GITHUB_USERNAME_HERE]

Example:

https://api.rigle.co/github-streak/stats/franznkemaka

Returns:

{
    "totalContributions": xxxxx,
    "firstContribution": "xxxx-xx-xx",
    "longestStreak": {
        "start": "xxxx-xx-xx",
        "end": "xxxx-xx-xx",
        "days": xxxx
    },
    "currentStreak": {
        "start": "xxxx-xx-xx",
        "end": "xxxx-xx-xx",
        "days": xxxx
    }
}

```

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How it works?

Using GitHub GraphQL, we collect all contribution years of the provided user. GitHub Calendar is limited to a single year only. In order to obtain a full contribution calendar ever, we grab all calendars one-by-one in parallel.

For better performance, the collected information are cached.

The longest streak is the highest consecutive days

The current streak is the total days before a 0 contribution-day
